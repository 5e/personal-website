Yet another developer blog.
<br><br>
_What do I even put here?_

I don't know, something interesting would be a good shout.
<br><br>
_Who's even going to read this?_

Probably no one. I guess it can be a place to reflect on my journey as a developer and reminisce things I've used in the past when they eventually become obsolete or deprecated. So, the year is 2023, I'm a full stack developer using Vue JS, C# and SQL, recently discovered GitHub Copilot and it is quite handy.
<br><br>
_Why not just use WordPress or Medium like everyone else?_

Because I didn't want to navigate to another page to open a blog, feels a bit clunky. Just used a Supabase database to store these blog posts in markdown, then I'm using [marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) to parse it to HTML.
<br><br>
Maybe in the future I will use some sort of static site generator for this blog as that is the hype these days.
