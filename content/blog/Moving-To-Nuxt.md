So... I have recreated this website with a new design and moved it to Nuxt.
<br><br>
This is my first time using Nuxt so I'm still learning now things, but enjoying it so far.
<br><br>
Pro tip: When using Netlify to deploy Nuxt apps and you see a 404 error on your website: ignore Netlify's default Nuxt config using publish directory ".nuxt/dist", it should just be "dist". Took me too long to figure this out.
